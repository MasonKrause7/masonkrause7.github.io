                <h3>Military Experience</h3>
                <p>From 2015 to 2020 I served in the US Army, as an infantryman in the 101st Airborne Division. During that time I acquired additional skill identifiers such as the Expert Infantry Badge, Pathfinder, and Air Assault.
                    Each of those skill identifiers came after rigorous testing of my ability to pay close attention to detail, even under harsh conditions and immense pressure. 
                    I learned valuable leadership skills as I had the opportunity to lead 4 men on a reconnaissance team, often operating independently for 72 hours or more to collect raw surveillance data.
                    My military experience taught me how to work as a team to accomplish the mission, no matter what obstacles arise.
                </p>
                <h3>Real Estate Experience</h3>
                <p>After the military, I decided to pursue an industry I was interested in: Real Estate. I figured the best way to learn about real estate and investing in it was to get in the action, so I obtained my real estate license and became a full time agent.
                    My first year, I closed 12 deals, with an average sales price of $255,000. My second year I closed 14 deals with an average sales price of $265,000.
                    The greatest thing I learned while working in real estate was the entrepreneur mindset. I learned how to take initiative to plan, execute, and follow up on marketing campaigns.
                    I also learned what it means to build a brand in an oversaturated market, and how providing real measurable value to customers is the best way to build a business. 
                </p>
                <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
                <p>I always knew I wanted to learn how to make apps because I saw it as an opportunity to create ideas out of thin air - an appealing thought. In 2019 I started working through various online resources and trying to teach myself to code. The more I learned about programming, the more I realized how vast the field is and how much more I still had to learn.
                    I decided to go back to school to pursue a bachelors degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics at Austin Peay State University.
                    I joined the university's competitive programming team and competed in the International Collegiate Programming Competition in 2024 and 2025, greatly improving my problem solving and programming ability.
                    My coursework provided me the solid foundation in CS and mathematics that I sought when I originally set out to learn to code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my current position at Data Annotation Tech, I work with a variety of AI models which are specifically designed to produce software and solve math/reasoning problems.
